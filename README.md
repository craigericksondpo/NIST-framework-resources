# NIST-framework-resources
## my resource contributions to NIST Frameworks


This repo is intended to contain multiple resources for the NIST Privacy Framework, Cybersecurity Framework, and AI Risk Management Framework.
The first contribution is to the NIST Privacy Framework, CCPA-Regs-to-SP800-53r5-to-pf-mappings.xlsx, a crosswalk that provides a 3-way mapping between: 1) the CCPA Final Regulations, effective 3/29/2023,
and 2) a selected subset of SP 800-53 controls which support legal compliance with the CCPA Final Regulations, 
and 3) Subcategories in the Privacy Framework Core Subcategories (aka "Privacy Framework Outcomes").  
Contributions accepted for inclusion into NIST resource repositories will be maintained by NIST by the author, Craig Erickson.
Issues, comments, pull requests and other updates from users can be made in this repository for staging purposes, prior to updating each contribution in NIST's repository.
Documentation and other useful artifacts will also be maintained here in this repository.
